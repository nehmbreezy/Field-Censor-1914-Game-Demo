A FIELD CENSOR'S MANUAL, 1st EDITION: The common soldier is prone to revealing important military information without due thought. As outlined in the Defence of the Realm Act, a field censor must ensure that none of this sensitive content is sent in the mail, where it might be intercepted by citizens, or worse, enemy spies. 
As field censor you will be given the letters of the men in your battalion. Before they are mailed off, you must carry out the following tasks. Obey with vigilance and you will be rewarded.
TASKS: 1. Censor any specific place names.
EXEMPLAR CENSORSHIP: We are in >>Ypres<< which is in Belgium.
HOW TO USE YOUR TOOLS: To censor, select the pencil in your toolbar. Click and drag over the text that needs to be censored. To move postcards around your desk, select the hand tool in your toolbar and click and drag.
