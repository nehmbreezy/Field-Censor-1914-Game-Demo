Dear Herman, # A quick line to share some ripping news. We’ve finally moved! As you know my battn. was holed up in &some backwater village in sussex& for nearly three months in a school the army reclaimed, sleeping like sardines on hard floor, training every day with old rifles and games of football, all for the glory of the nation etc hurrah hurrah. # I'm chuffed because for the longest time I thought we fresh recruits would only be posted to the coast to wait for a possible German invasion. Thankfully not. After a horrendously long voyage we've arrived &in camp at& *Popperinghe,* &Belgium, behind the actual fighting line.& The word is that we will be moving out within the week to support our boys &at the front at& *Ypres*. # You slacker you missing out on all this fun.You’ll regret it of that I’m sure. While you’re studying your history books I’ll be making history over here. All the men feel the same; spirits are high. # Your fondest friend, Felix x
