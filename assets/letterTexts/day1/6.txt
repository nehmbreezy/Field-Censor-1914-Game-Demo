wDear Mother, # I’m so sorry I couldn’t write sooner, because good old Jake and I have finally joining up with a real battalion — &in France!& No more training &in sussex.& We have travelled far and are so excited to be in a different country we can hardly sleep. They’ve holed us up in cramped quarters with hardly a latrine for fifteen men but our spirits are unbreakable. We haven’t been here long but we already passed a whole battalion marching and singing 'It’s a long way to tipperay' and it was so uplifting. We’ve already had one excellent meal with bully and fresh bread. We are itching to get to &the front at& *Ypres* wh ere we hear action is happening. The huns — as they call them — will quiver when they see us! # It is so different here from the brush factory and home I can’t begin to explain it. Jake and I are keeping each other good company because we hardly know any of the other men yet but I’m sure we will make great friends. And yes of course Jake still writes to his ‘darling Miranda’ every day. # Best wishes to the family, Michael x
