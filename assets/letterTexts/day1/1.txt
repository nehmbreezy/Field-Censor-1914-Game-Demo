TO Field Censor 1804 of the 148th Infantry Brigade, 49th Division Her Royal Majesty’s British Expeditionary Force, October 24th 1914
GENERAL STAFF'S UPDATE ON THE CONDUCT OF THE WAR: This summer the barbaric German army invaded innocent Belgium and France, committing foul atrocities against innocent civilians and entrenching themselves on bloodied soil. 
Thanks to the bravery and expertise of the British Expeditionary Force, the Kaiser's forces were halted in their tracks on a longitudinal line stretching from the coast of Belgium all the way south into France. Most of our forces are concentrated in a small bulge in this line, the Ypres salient, in central Belgium. In the coming weeks, bolstered by the 400,000 new British soldiers from Lord Kitchener’s recruitment drive and using Ypres as our base, we and our French allies will repel the German monolith.
Victory is on the horizon. By Christmas we shall be celebrating in London. 
For God, Glory, and Nation.
Signed, Major General Punt
