Dearest Lilipoppin, # Dearest I have such tremendous news for you. It seems your gregory  will have the chance to fight &on the front in& *flanders* not on the coast &of England like& he first thought. Your dear Greg is writing this while he travels on an unsteady officer’s ship on the channel with poor lamplight and will post it first thing when he arrives wherever he is being shipped to. # Darling Lilian I know you the whole thing distresses you but I am an able-bodied man and every man in the nation has a duty to fulfill when war comes. If every man was to fret over himself and his own life we’d never defeat the Kaiser’s barbarians at our door. And I couldn’t live with myself if I didn’t enlist at once. # I think given this turn of events the wedding must be postponed again for now dearest. I’m terribly sorry. But I promise darling that we’ll be wed as soon as I next have leave. Oh how I miss you and your little body. # Fondest love, your Gregory x
