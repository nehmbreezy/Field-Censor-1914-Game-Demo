Dear wife Clementine, # You and will and maggie are always on my mind I say a prayer every day for you all. # You must not be worrying but day before yesterday a staff officer told us all our training was nearly finished and we’d be mobilising to join Kitcheners new army at the front where the germans be pushing hard against us. I couldnt write sooner because we are all terrible busy with packing and moving and marching but after a long journey we are here in &belgim,& I think its near &a place called& *wipers* from what they say. We are set up in a little old house with twenty men per room its not quite home but I’ll be getting used to it. # We are all well pleased to be moving at last and I think with Gods grace we should soon be at the frontlines helping our boys. # Love and prayers for you, Richard x
