Dear Herman, # My nerves are a little shaken, I must admit. Last night we finally moved forward to reserve trenches via the ruined town &from which the salient gets its name,& *ypres.*  A ridiculous length of time spent driving in busses in sopping rain and darkness. The town was chaotic. Our faces lit only by the flickering of shell-light, town fires, and enemy flares, officers shouting directions and all of us shuffling around. The battalions we passed — the men we are replacing — were haggard and few. They gave us hard stares and didn’t say anything as we passed. As we were marching out of town, a shrieking metallic sound engulfed us. A blast of air hit me and I was thrown off my feet. *Two* &of& our battalion &were killed in the shell-blast. There’s not much left of their bodies.& One of them I had said good morning to just today, he was rather good-looking. I suppose that’s our initiation. Left me with a bitter taste in my mouth. # Now we are all exhausted in reserve trenches and dinner is not yet here. Well, we knew there would be hardships. # Your shivering chum, Felix x
