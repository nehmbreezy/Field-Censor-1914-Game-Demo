Dear Mother, # Under cover of dusk we rode a bus last night &from france deep into& *ypres.* Jake and I were luckily in the same bus so we chatted about back home and how he and Miranda are getting on. But it started to rain and the roads were in a terrible condition so some of the busses kept getting stuck in the muddy channels. One time we stopped and all had to get out and help push out of a ditch in the pitch black. It’s a good thing we have a fighting spirit in us else we’d all be miserable. # As we neared *ypres’s* darkening horizon we heard nothing but distant booms and the occasional flashes of light over the land, silhouetting the dead trees. All the men went a little quiet, or maybe just sleepy because it was rather late. As we got &closer to& *ypres* the booms got louder. There was a little incident &in& *ypres* but I am fine don’t worry. Had another long march after &along the& *menin* &road& and finally are in a reserve trench. I am thinking of you and the family. # Michael x
