Dear Clementine, # Weve been moved up to help defend against the huns on the line. We keeping good spirits and God is with us. All is well, so fret not. It were an easy ride &to& *yepers* &then& *menin*. There is shelling from the enemy but it an’t so distressing and they hardly ever hit anything, thank Him. # We were singing hymns as we marched the last stretch into the reserve trenches but as we got closer our voices got quieter like and then an officer came up to us and snapped at us to be quiet so we stopped that and there wasn’t sound but marching mud and shells in the distance. the trenches start off as little slopes into the ground and then before long they are up to your chest and then neck and its dark here and very winding like a big maze and easy to get lost. we are pressed up against mud walls and little dugouts and the light to write by is pitiful so ill end the line here darling but worry not for a little discomfort is nothing to me. God watches over us. # your richard x
