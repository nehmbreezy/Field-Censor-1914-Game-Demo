Dearest ownest Lilian, # Good news darling. My string-pulling worked and I’ve gotten myself assigned to a battalion moving up to the front &at& *ypres* to defend against a massive German push that is still ongoing. I’m in charge of fifteen recruits, only they don’t know that I’m a new recruit too. In half an hour we are boarding a train, then a bus (a real London bus can you imagine!) to take us on the eight hour drive &to& *ypres* &proper,& then another drive down &to& *Menin.* Where exactly I won’t know until I’m there. All under cover of night not to mention. # It’s all so exciting, and a little bit nerve-wracking too I suppose. It is one thing to cheer war on and promise to defend her majesty’s empire from the huns. It is another to march to a battlefield. Oh but I’ll be fine, dont you worry ownest I am the fittest officer around and I’m ready for what’s to come. Missing you the most darling little girl and your little body. # Your fiancee Gregory x
