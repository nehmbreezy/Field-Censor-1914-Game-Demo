IMPORTANT UPDATE FOR FIELD CENSORS:
In war, the side with the most information drastically increases their chance of success. We cannot let the enemy gain any advantage in this respect. The following sensitive information must be censored from soldier's letters, in addition to the existing regulations, to prevent it reaching the public eye.
TASKS:
