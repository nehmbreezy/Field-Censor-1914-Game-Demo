Dear Mother and Father, # Yes I’d say stick with the American stocks — shipping, weapons, cars, etc. — and avoid canadian bonds for now, I have a feeling the Americans will join in, and you know how I am about these feelings. Contact my banker &in london& who can advise you further. # We have been on the move here, a long ride &from france into the heart of& *flanders.* It is quite cold, nothing like canada, but we are not so equipped for it. It doesn’t help that that ass Matthew who is supposed to issue our extra winter gear is only distributing his limited supply to men who do him favours, like some boy named Jake who lent him a pack of cards and the address of a brothel &near& *ypres.* Likewise with a small stock of steel helmets; they are supposed to be standard issue but there aren’t enough yet for all of us so Matthew hoards them. # Anyway, plotting against him is a necessary distraction. Our trenches are a wet mess and we have little to do but wait for possible raids from the enemy. Don’t worry, though, I’m quite comfortable and safe. # Yours, Firth x
