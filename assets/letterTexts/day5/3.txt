Dearest Lilian, # After overnighting in a reserve trench we marched up to the frontlines at *nonnebosson* &woods& this morning before dawn. We are a few hundred yards from the Germans dearest but very safe in our trenches and it’s not so exciting as it sounds, we don’t see any of them. There is little to be done during the day because one can’t walk around freely so I mostly stay in my dugout, which is a comfortable little den with a writing desk and candles. We are fully geared in our boots and rifles because we expect the Germans might attack at any time. Darling hubbins is very safe though don’t worry. He is wearing his lucky necklace rock and so far it is terribly effective. The Germans are shelling but their shells land far away from your Gregory. # Well it is not quite as expected but I am glad nonetheless that I pressed my commander to let me come up here. # Excellent news dear about the house. You must act quickly and close the deal in my absence. Tell me everything that happens. I miss you achingly. # Love from your Gregory x
