Darling Jacqueline, # And tu? Ca va? You see, I haven’t forgotten what you taught me. # Thank you darling J (may I call you that?) for the pressed flowers and the charm bracelet. I shall shake my fist at the Germans when they next attack our little trench &in& *menin* and they will be instantly seduced. I assume you used a similar bracelet on me because I was truly charmed by your smile and can’t wait to see you again. I will write again when I’m safe. For you see I’m in constant danger here. If not frostbite then shell-fire could take me at any moment, that is, if I wasn’t such an brilliant soldier. Don’t you worry. Any hardship is worth it to protect villages like yours and women like you. # Till soon, # ton Jake x
