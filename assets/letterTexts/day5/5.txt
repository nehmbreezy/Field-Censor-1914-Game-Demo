Dear Herman, Last night’s rain turned into today’s snowy slush and our trenches are drenches and our morale is soaked. You old slacker bastard. # Our job during the daytime consists of staying still in freezing muddy wall-crevices which they call dugouts, waiting for the enemy to shells us. Which he does. All. The. Time. There’s nothing we can do against the shells except cross our fingers and squeeze our arses so we don’t loose our bowels when the shrieking explosions hit. Makes one wish for a suit of armour. *One* &dead and& *three* &injured in a shell& just thirty yards from me this morning.Though I’m glad the huns don’t attack because we’re limited to firing four rounds per day due to shortages. # You know I still haven’t seen No Man’s Land — let alone a live Hun — because we can’t look over the top without getting shot. (Apparently that preacher I told you about last time is one of our snipers who watches No-Man’s land for enemy heads.) # Our 'drenches' are winding decrepit mud channels with strewn sandbags lying around. Our ‘successful defence &of& *ypres’* is not very pretty. From your bloody cold Felix # PS: Send chocolate. x x
