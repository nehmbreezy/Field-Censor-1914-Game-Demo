Dear clementine, # I cant bear to be thinking of little will and maggie living in a place where german zeplins might bomb them from the heavens. God save us from this new world where children must blow out their candles in eveningtime because little villages are in the crosshairs of armies. # during rifle practice today God guided my hand n’ i scored a division record. an officer noticed and was chatting to me about joining a small group of snipers. Ive had a good thought about it and I think ill agree. i had some doubts because it seems wrong to kill a man from a distance if he never sees you. But I suppose God gave me this gift for a reason. to use against the godless. # speaking of the godless: my tent companion is an odd one, name is felix and he speaks posh like and looks foregn. yesterday I walked into our tent and interrupted him committing foul self-pleasure. I think God is testing me. praise Him that the other men are god-loving cheerful, patriotic folk. # yours, richard x
