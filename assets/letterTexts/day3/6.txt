Dear Gertrude, # Were you a queen in another life, dear Gertrude? You have the manner of one, and the beauty. You don’t fool me with your disguise as a baker’s daughter. Your buns may be outstanding, but I see beyond that, into your royal grace and charm. I left your bakery in a daze, and it was not from the smell of yeast and flour, but the smell of your neck where I kissed you, you flower. # A piece of my heart will forever reside in your bakery &on& *ringhepoort road,* &in& *popperinghe.* I will be back, you royal charmer. And I hope there are the chocolate twist breads when I return, because those are very, very good. Or maybe you could send me some by mail. Remember to include my regiment number, written on this envelope. Oh, and I also love the brown bread with the cheese inside. I will need nourishment while I’m out fighting the Germans, and it will make me think of you, no doubt. # With heady admiration, Jake x
