Dear Amelie, # Oh mon tres beautiful Madame, it was so wonderful to meet you and practice my language skills with you. You have positively enraptured me and I fear I will have to see you again or perish slowly for want of your lips and chocolate smile. After I have defeated the Germans barking at your borders (I think I will need a few weeks and my uniform might get a bit spoiled) I will rush back to your village &in& *havre* and sweep you off your feet and we will practice much more French, for it is a lovely language and you are a lovely woman. # Before I was a dashing soldier I was apprenticed to a newspaper journalist. After the fighting is over I will write an article in the news about your beauty — the world needs to know! # I received some sweets from friends &in England, some sussex& plum-cakes, which I am sending to you (hopefully they are not yet stale). Enjoy, darling Amelie. Hopefully they will suffice for now to mend the hole in your heart which my absence has no doubt left. # Yours, Jake xoxox o
