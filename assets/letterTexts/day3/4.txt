Dear Herman, # More news to make your regret staying &in Cambridge,& I’m afraid. Yesterday there was a wonderfully rowdy performance of It's a Long Way to tiperay, with extra beer. By the end of it everyone was practically waving flags and hurrahing. Today was the last official day of rest &in& *popper,* including rifle practice and some physical training. I’m thoroughly enjoying being surrounded by so many enthusiastic and strong young country boys sweating and horseplaying. Of course none compare to you and your rowing-team torso but it’s not all bad here at all, not bad at all. # The one downer is that I’m tented with some thirty-something-year-old prig, a family man from &Sussex& who wears a cross and doesn’t let you forget it. I don’t think he suspects I prefer, how shall I say it, carrots and onions over peaches and plums, but he certainly doesn’t like me, and I can’t stand his constant praying and praise God etc. The soldiers here are itching to get out there and shoot some huns, have adventures, make love to french ladies (and perhaps boys), and God’s virtue is the last thing on their minds. Must end the line but thinking of you. Your one-true-chum Felix x
