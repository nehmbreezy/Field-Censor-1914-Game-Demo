Dear Mother and Father, # I will write to you before you reply because I know that your letters will take a long time to get here from &vancouver.& Just a line to rant about &belgium's& most abusive quartermaster, Matthew. # Before he issued any of our essential equipment (rifle rags, boots, puttees, spare cartridges, etc.), he had me and a gaggle of other new recruits as his private slaves: I did latrine duty for his private billet, brought him cold drinks, delivered supplies to other battalions. It was only later we found out that we were the jokes &of& *popper.* What’s worse: he promised that he’d safekeep my cigarettes and package gifts for a small price. He took my fee, then sold it all his officer buddies and laughed in my face. # He isn’t even half decent at his job; I saw his quartermaster’s ledger while doing his chores. As a successful boutique shopkeeper and semi-successful restaurateur I could do far better. # Aside from that nonsense, the men here are outstandingly excited to get out &of& *popper* and start fighting. Admittedly I’m a little nervous, but once we get started I know it’ll be smooth sailing. # Yours, Firth x
