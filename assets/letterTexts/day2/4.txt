Dear Miranda # I hope all is well with you and your family in &arndel.& As I ’m sure jake has told you our battalion has been moved to &belgium.& It is all so exciting; we have never been so far from home. Jake is always scribbling letters to you when we have rest time in our little wooden billet so I thought I’d drop you a line to see how things are back at home. # I just want you to know that there are no hard feelings at all and I’m terribly embarrassed about those letters I sent you last month. I didn’t realise that you already belonged to Jake and I’m awfully sorry for blundering in like that. I hope we can still be friends as normal like. # I’m sure Jake has told you all about what war’s like so I won’t bore you. We are both very fit and well fed and so excited to join our brothers in arms at the front to help defend the empire. # Do write if you can spare the time. I enjoy receiving any letters, even short ones. # Your friend Michael x
