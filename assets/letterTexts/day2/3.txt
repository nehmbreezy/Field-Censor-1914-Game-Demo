Dear Mother and Father, # To be honest I was glad to get out &of London.& Kate has been telling me how lucky I am to have gotten away. Our restaurant is doing poorly. I suppose &Londoners& aren’t so keen on new-age vegetarian food during wartime. To make things worse panicked misers artificially raised food prices by mass-buying groceries (fearing a German invasion) until the Government put their foot down. Then there are the blackouts — the whole of &southern England& turning their lights off at night just so German zeppelins won’t bomb us — madness! Kate says the suffragette riots have been put on hold for a while and that the movement has actually lent their support to the PM for the first time in God only knows. Radical feminists helping Kitchener with his big recruitment drive — who saw that coming? # As for me, after some days in bureaucratic limbo I’ve finally arrived &in a French town called& *popper.* Morale is sky-high — with one exception. Have to go now but in my next letter I will tell you all about my discovery of the world’s most intolerable ass: our new quartermaster Lieutenant Matthew. # Love, Firth x
