Darling Miranda, # What a scoundrel! How a man could even lay eyes upon you, you gorgeous country maiden, without kneeling to kiss your hand and promising to fulfil your any and every desire, is absolutely beyond me. The next time he comes around to your mother’s house demanding to requisition your toolshed and your wheelbarrows for army purposes you must tell him ever-so-sweetly that you are doing your bit already — by sending your loving support to a dashing soldier &in France who& is almost single-handedly turning the tide of the war. And then ask him why HE is stealing wheelbarrows rather than fighting with our army at the front instead? That will surely put him in his place. # Now for the serious news — as you most probably have heard from my chum Michael (who has transcended from brush-factory worker to gallant soldier), we are &on the way to& *Ypres!* I’m writing from a little battered shack they call &‘resting billet’ in& *Popperinghe,* &some miles behind.& I’ve never been fitter, darling, I’m practically bursting out of my uniform. Must end the line, but thinking of you constantly, you gorgeous girl. # Love, Jake x
