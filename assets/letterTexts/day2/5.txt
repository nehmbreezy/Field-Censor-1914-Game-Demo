Dearest Lilian, # I told you when I drove up there to &Dover& to see the house that the view was of a nearby factory and it wasn’t a place I want us to live together in once we are wed. Ask our agent about houses with a better view won’t you? # I’ve been assigned as the warden of a small platoon &in& *Popperinghe,* &Beligum.& I review the paperwork of a few dozen newly-trained recruits. Oh, and organise their football team. They are all camping just outside *poppperinghe* while we officers relax in comfortable billets. I’m in excellent health of course, fit as ever. # While I’m sure you’re glad to hear I’m on a desk job, I am terribly frustrated. Because I can write and read I languish here while other men fight man-to-man. I’m hardly better than a coward. Every day we hear of new German assaults &on the line at& *iepres.* I’m pulling all the strings I can to get a new assignment as a front-line officer. # Sorry to rant. I feel imprisoned and miss you terribly. I cherish thoughts of our future together, my ownest. Everlastingly yours, Gregory x
